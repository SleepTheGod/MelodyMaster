# MelodyMaster
MelodyMaster is a Discord music bot that plays music from YouTube. Users can join voice channels and control playback with simple commands like /play, /pause, and /stop. The bot automatically pauses when no users are in the voice channel and resumes playback when users return, ensuring an uninterrupted listening experience.
